ðŸ¤– Automated Machine Learning Model Construction & Iteration in Quantitative Finance 

Intro
~~~~~~~~~~~

In this scenario, our automated system proposes hypothesis, constructs model, implements code, receives back-testing, and uses feedbacks. Hypothesis is iterated in this continuous process. The system aims to automatically optimise performance metrics from Qlib library thereby finding the optimised code through autonomous research and development.

Automated R&D of model in Quantitative Finance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**R (Research)**
- Iteration of ideas and hypotheses.
- Continuous learning and knowledge construction.

**D (Development)**
- Evolving code generation and model refinement.
- Automated implementation and testing of models.

Objective
~~~~~~~~~

The demo showcases the iterative process of hypothesis generation, knowledge construction, and decision-making in model construction in quantitative finance. It highlights how models evolve through continuous feedback and refinement, therefore building the domain knowledge specific to the scenario of quantitative finance.

Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To quickly start the model proposal process, run the following command in your terminal within the 'rdagent' virtual environment:

.. code-block:: sh

    python rdagent/app/qlib_rd_loop/model_w_sc.py

Usage of modules
