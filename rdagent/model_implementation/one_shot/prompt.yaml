  With the following given information, write a python code using pytorch and torch_geometric to implement the model.
  This model is in the graph learning field, only have one layer.
  The input will be node_feature [num_nodes, dim_feature] and edge_index [2, num_edges]  (It would be the input of the forward model)
  There is not edge attribute or edge weight as input. The model should detect the node_feature and edge_index shape, if there is Linear transformation layer in the model, the input and output shape should be consistent. The in_channels is the dimension of the node features.
  Implement the model forward function based on the following information:model formula information.
  1. model name:{{name}}
  2. model description:{{description}}
  3. model formulation:{{formulation}}
  4. model variables:{{variables}}.
  You must complete the forward function as far as you can do.
  \# Execution
  Your implemented code will be exectued in the follow way
  {{execute_desc}}
