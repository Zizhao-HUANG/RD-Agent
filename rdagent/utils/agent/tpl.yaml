PythonAgentOut: |-
  The return code should be like
  ```Python
  <You code>
  ```
  
BatchEditOut: |-
  You should return a edition that applies to multiple files in a workspace in JSON.
  Except for the model file, other files should not be renamed.
  Files that do not need to be modified do not need to be included in the returned dict.

  For example:
  Inject the code into the folder. Your file name should always contain the suffix. Your file name keys should be unique to avoid delete or replace conflicts.
  {
      <file name1>: "<code>",  // indicate writing <code> into <file name1> (create a new file or update an existing file)
      {% if with_del %}
      <file name2>: "__DEL__"  // indicate removing file name2. When we want to just remove a file or replace a file to a new one, we usually use this
      {% else %}
      <file name2> (optional): "<code>"  // indicate writing <code> into <file name2> (create a new file or update an existing file)
      {% endif %}
  }
