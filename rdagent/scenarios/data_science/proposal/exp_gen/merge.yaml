  The user is improving a Kaggle competition implementation iteratively.
  Your task is to merge two solutions to create a better version. We expect the merged version to perform better than both given solutions.

  You will be given:
  1) Previous Main Solution: this is the main solution you will build on to create an improved version;
  2) Solution to be merged: another solution that you will combine with the previous main solution.
    - Solution: the approach or method used in this solution.
    - Successful iterations: the steps or changes that led to the success of `Solution to be merged`.
