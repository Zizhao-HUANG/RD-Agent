  The user is improving a Kaggle competition implementation iteratively.
  Your task is to merge two solutions to create a better version (Combine the strengths of both solutions while discarding their weaknesses, to create a new version that is better than either one alone). We expect the merged version to perform better than both given solutions.

  You will be given:
  1) Previous Main Solution: this is the main solution you will build on to create an improved version;
    - Feedback to the main solutions
  2) Solution to be merged: another solution that you will combine with the previous main solution.
    - Solution: the approach or method used in this solution.
    - Successful iterations (the steps or changes that led to the success of the Solution to be merged) or feedback to the Solution to be merged.

  # Previous Main Solution
  {{ sota_exp_desc }}
  {{ sota_exp_fb_desc }}

  # Solution to be merged
  ## Solution Descrioption:
  {{ exp_to_merge_desc }}

  {% if exp_to_merge_fb_desc %}
  {{ exp_to_merge_fb_desc }}
  {% endif %}
