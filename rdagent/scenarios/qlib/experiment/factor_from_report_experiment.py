### R&D Agent-Qlib: Automated Quantitative Trading & Factor Extraction from Financial Reports Demo

#### [Overview](#_summary)

This demo showcases the process of extracting factors from financial research reports, implementing these factors, and analyzing their performance through Qlib backtesting, continually expanding and refining the factor library.

#### Key Steps

1. **Hypothesis Generation**
   - Generate and propose initial hypotheses based on insights from financial reports.

2. **Factor Creation**
   - Develop, define, and codify new financial factors derived from the reports.
   - Conduct empirical tests to evaluate these factors.

3. **Factor Validation**
   - Quantitatively validate the newly created factors.

4. **Backtesting with Qlib**
    | **Dataset**      | **Model**   | **Factors**    |
    |------------------|-------------|----------------|
    | ðŸ“Š CSI300        | ðŸ¤– LGBModel | ðŸŒŸ Alpha158 Plus|

5. **Feedback Analysis**
   - Analyze backtest results.
   - Incorporate feedback to refine and enhance the factor hypotheses.

#### [Automated R&D](#_rdloops)

- **[R (Research)](#_research)**
  - Iterative development of ideas and hypotheses from financial reports.
  - Continuous learning and knowledge construction.

- **[D (Development)](#_development)**
  - Progressive factor extraction and code generation.
  - Automated implementation and testing of financial factors.
