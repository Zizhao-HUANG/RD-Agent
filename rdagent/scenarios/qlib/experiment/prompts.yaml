  Quantitative investment is a data-driven approach to asset management that relies on mathematical models, statistical techniques, and computational methods to analyze financial markets and make investment decisions. Two essential components of this approach are factors and models.
  
  You are one of the most authoritative quantitative researchers at a top Wall Street hedge fund. I need your expertise to develop new factors and models that can enhance our investment returns. Based on the given context, I will ask for your assistance in designing and implementing either factors or a model.


qlib_factor_background: |-
  The factor is a characteristic or variable used in quant investment that can help explain the returns and risks of a portfolio or a single asset. Factors are used by investors to identify and exploit sources of excess returns, and they are central to many quantitative investment strategies.
  Each number in the factor represents a physics value to an instrument on a day.
  User will train a model to predict the next several days return based on the factor values of the previous days.
  The factor is defined in the following parts:
  1. Name: The name of the factor.
  2. Description: The description of the factor.
  3. Formulation: The formulation of the factor.
  4. Variables: The variables or functions used in the formulation of the factor.
  The factor might not provide all the parts of the information above since some might not be applicable.
  Please specifically give all the hyperparameter in the factors like the window size, look back period, and so on. One factor should statically defines one output with a static source data. For example, last 10 days momentum and last 20 days momentum should be two different factors.

  # CONTEXT: You are an expert Python developer creating a Qlib-compatible factor calculation script.
  # OBJECTIVE: Generate a standalone Python script to calculate a single financial factor.

  # --- RULES ---
  - The script must be directly executable: `python <file_name>.py`
  - It must contain a single public function: `calculate_<factor_name>()`.
  - Use a standard main guard: `if __name__ == "__main__":`.
  - Do NOT use `try/except` blocks.

  # --- I/O SPECIFICATION ---
  - **Input**: Load data from `daily_pv.h5` using `pd.read_hdf("daily_pv.h5", key="data")`.
  - **Output**: Save the result to `result.h5` with key `"data"`.
  - **Output DataFrame Structure**:
    - **Index**: A `MultiIndex` of `("datetime", "instrument")`.
    - **Columns**: A single column named `<FactorName>`.
    - **Dtype**: `float`.
    - **Values**: Must not contain any `NaN` or `inf` values.

  # --- CORE LOGIC: The "Reset-Group-Set" Pattern ---
  # This pattern is MANDATORY for any grouped rolling/shifting operations to avoid index alignment errors.

  # 1. RESET: Flatten the MultiIndex to work with regular columns.
  df_reset = df.reset_index()
  df_reset.sort_values(["instrument", "datetime"], inplace=True) # Crucial for time-series ops

  # 2. GROUP & CALCULATE: Perform calculations on the flattened DataFrame.
  #    Use `.transform()` to ensure the output Series has a matching index.
  #    Example for a 20-day rolling sum of volume:
  df_reset["factor_value"] = (
      df_reset.groupby("instrument")["$volume"]
              .transform(lambda s: s.rolling(20).sum())
  )
  # WARNING: NEVER do `df.groupby(...).rolling(...)` directly. It creates an incompatible index.

  # 3. SET: Restore the MultiIndex and rename the column for the final output.
  out = (
      df_reset[["datetime", "instrument", "factor_value"]]
      .set_index(["datetime", "instrument"])
      .rename(columns={"factor_value": "<FactorName>"})
  )

  # --- FINAL SCRIPT STRUCTURE ---
  # Your final code should strictly follow this template.
  import pandas as pd
  import numpy as np

  def calculate_<factor_name>():
      # 1. Load data
      df = pd.read_hdf("daily_pv.h5", key="data")

      # 2. Implement the "Reset-Group-Set" pattern for factor calculation
      #    ... your calculation logic here ...
      #    The final result of the calculation should be in a DataFrame named `out`.

      # 3. Pre-Save Validation (MANDATORY)
      assert out.index.is_unique, "Output index is not unique."
      assert np.isfinite(out.values).all(), "Output contains NaN or Inf values."
      assert out.columns.tolist() == ["<FactorName>"], "Output column name is incorrect."

      # 4. Save result
      out.to_hdf("result.h5", key="data", format="table")

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      calculate_<factor_name>()

qlib_factor_output_format: |-
  Your output should be a pandas dataframe similar to the following example information:
  <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
  MultiIndex: 40914 entries, (Timestamp('2020-01-02 00:00:00'), 'SH600000') to (Timestamp('2021-12-31 00:00:00'), 'SZ300059')
  Data columns (total 1 columns):
  #   Column            Non-Null Count  Dtype  
  ---  ------            --------------  -----  
  0   your factor name  40914 non-null  float64
  dtypes: float64(1)
  memory usage: <ignore>
  Notice: The non-null count is OK to be different to the total number of entries since some instruments may not have the factor value on some days.
  One possible format of `result.h5` may be like following:
  datetime    instrument
  2020-01-02  SZ000001     -0.001796
              SZ000166      0.005780
              SZ000686      0.004228
              SZ000712      0.001298
              SZ000728      0.005330
                              ...
  2021-12-31  SZ000750      0.000000

qlib_model_background: |-
  The model is a machine learning or deep learning structure used in quantitative investment to predict the returns and risks of a portfolio or a single asset. Models are employed by investors to generate forecasts based on historical data and identified factors, which are central to many quantitative investment strategies.
  Each model takes the factors as input and predicts the future returns. Usually, the bigger the model is, the better the performance would be.
  The model is defined in the following parts:
  1. Name: The name of the model.
  2. Description: The description of the model.
  3. Architecture: The detailed architecture of the model, such as neural network layers or tree structures.
  4. Hyperparameters: The hyperparameters used in the model.
  5. Training_hyperparameters: The hyperparameters used during the training process.
  6. ModelType: The type of the model, "Tabular" for tabular model and "TimeSeries" for time series model.
  The model should provide clear and detailed documentation of its architecture and hyperparameters. One model should statically define one output with a fixed architecture and hyperparameters.

qlib_model_interface: |-
  Your python code should follow the interface to better interact with the user's system.
  You code should contain several parts:
  1. The import part: import the necessary libraries.
  2. A class which is a sub-class of pytorch.nn.Module. This class should should have a init function and a forward function which inputs a tensor and outputs a tensor.
  3. Set a variable called "model_cls" to the class you defined.

qlib_model_output_format: |-
  Your output should be a tensor with shape (batch_size, 1). 
  The output tensor should be saved in a file named "output.pth" in the same directory as your python file.
  The user will evaluate the shape of the output tensor so the tensor read from "output.pth" should be 8 numbers.

qlib_model_simulator: |-
  The models will be sent into Qlib to train and evaluate their performance in predicting future returns. Hypothesis is improved upon checking the feedback on the results. 
  Qlib is an AI-oriented quantitative investment platform that aims to realize the potential, empower research, and create value using AI technologies in quantitative investment, from exploring ideas to implementing productions. Qlib supports diverse machine learning modeling paradigms, including supervised learning, market dynamics modeling, and reinforcement learning (RL).
  User will use Qlib to automatically perform the following tasks:
  1. Generate a baseline factor table.
  2. Train the model defined in your class Net to predict the next several days' returns based on the factor values.
  3. Build a portfolio based on the predicted returns using a specific strategy.
  4. Evaluate the portfolio's performance, including metrics such as return, IC, max drawdown, and others.
  5. Iterate on growing the hypothesis to enable model improvements based on performance evaluations and feedback.
