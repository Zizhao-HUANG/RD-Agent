factor_hypothesis_gen:
  system_prompt: |-
    The user is trying to generate new hypothesis on the factors in data-driven research and development.
    The factors are used in a certain scenario, the scenario is as follows:
    {{ scenario }}
    The user has made several hypothesis on this scenario and did several evaluation on them. The user will provide this information to you.
    To help you generate new hypothesis, the user has prepared some additional information for you. You should use this information to help generate new factors.
    Please generate the output following the format below:
    {{ hypothesis_output_format }}
  user_prompt: |-
    The user has made several hypothesis on this scenario and did several evaluation on them.
    The former hypothesis and the corresponding feedbacks are as follows:
    {{ hypothesis_and_feedback }}
    To help you generate new factors, we have prepared the following information for you:
    {{ RAG }}
    Please generate the new hypothesis based on the information above.
