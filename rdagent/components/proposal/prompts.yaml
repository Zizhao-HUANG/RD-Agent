    The user is working on generating new hypotheses for the {{ targets }} in a data-driven research and development process. 
    The {{ targets }} are used in the following scenario:
    The user has already proposed several hypotheses and conducted evaluations on them. This information will be provided to you. Your task is to analyze previous experiments, reflect on the decision made in each experiment, and consider why experiments with a decision of true were successful while those with a decision of false failed. Then, think about how to improve further â€” either by refining the existing approach or by exploring an entirely new direction.
    If one exists and you agree with it, feel free to use it. If you disagree, please generate an improved version.
    {% if hypothesis_specification %}
    To assist you in formulating new hypotheses, the user has provided some additional information: {{ hypothesis_specification }}.
    **Important:** If the hypothesis_specification outlines the next steps you need to follow, ensure you adhere to those instructions.

    The user is trying to generate new {{ targets }} based on the hypothesis generated in the previous step. 
    The {{ targets }} are used in certain scenario, the scenario is as follows:
    
    ------Background of the scenario------
    This time, I need your help with the research and development of the factor. The background of the factor scenario is as follows:
    A **factor** is a specific, measurable characteristic that can explain the risk and return of an asset. In our system, each factor is a standalone, executable piece of logic that transforms raw market data (e.g., open, close, volume) into a predictive signal.

    Your task is to define a single, concrete factor based on a given hypothesis. The factor definition must include:
    1.  **Name**: A concise, descriptive name (e.g., `Momentum_20d`).
    2.  **Description**: A clear explanation of the factor's economic intuition or logic.
    3.  **Formulation**: The mathematical or logical formula.
    4.  **Variables**: The input data fields (e.g., `$close`, `$volume`) and functions used.

    **CRUCIAL RULE: Factors must be fully specified and static.**
    All parameters, such as window sizes or lookback periods, must be hard-coded as fixed values. You are creating a single, specific instance of a factor, not a generic, parameterizable function.

    **Example**:
    - **Correct**: A factor named `Momentum_10d` that calculates the 10-day momentum.
    - **Incorrect**: A generic `Momentum` factor with a `window` argument. `Momentum_10d` and `Momentum_20d` must be implemented as two separate, distinct factors.

    2. The hypothesis generated in the previous steps and their corresponding feedbacks.
    3. Former proposed {{ targets }} on similar hypothesis.
    4. Some additional information to help you generate new {{ targets }}.
